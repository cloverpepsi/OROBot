Before we begin towards the tower, we need to know that you have a strategy to evade all the obscure and ridiculous obstacles that will definitely be on this perilous journey. How do you prepare to go on this dangerous adventure?
After a long walk from your home town to the tower, you finally enter the gate, cross the moat, and walk through the door to the first floor. The whole group gets inside the tower, it's very spacious, and you look around: There appears to be crates and puddles everywhere, most of it covered in gross slime. It's still too dark to see where the stairs to the second floor are, or even a door, but then it gets worse. The doors close behind you and the room is sealed dark. You hear sludging and sloshing around you, and you are surrounded by monsterous slimes you can't even see! How will you fight the slimes in the dark?
As the group traverses to through the slime, All but 5 individuals ascend, while the rest spend eternity being digested by gross slime. As the travelers ascend a suspiciously steep uphill incline with several convenient holes in the wall, a enormous rumble shakes the floor as a massive boulder hurls toward our group of heroes. They must now pick a hole to jump in before they meet a crushing fate! There are four holes. Hole A is a very open hole and looks like it can fit 12 members, though it looks like bait for a monster to come by and eat everyone. Hole B looks quite comfortable and safe, but can fit just 5 members.  Hole C is a little foggy from where our hero is standing, and the number it can contain is uncertain. Finally, Hole D has something very bright and shiny in it. However, it can fit just one individual. To live, you must get into your hole of choice by placing in the Top X for the people going for that hole, where X is the number of people it can fit. I can confirm, the sole adventurer who makes it into Hole D will get a very fabulous prize! So, basically, Which hole do you go for and why?
The boulder smashes against the back wall and you feel the tower shake around you as a result of the impact. You feel a drop of water on your shoulder, but do not think much of it. The party climbs up to the third floor, and the atmosphere of the room is humid. It feels as if an odour in the air is piercing your nostrils. Though it is dark, it is not nearly to the degree as the first floor was: You can still see your reflection in the puddles on the floor. As you turn your gaze up from the puddles, you realize that the room has an entire pool between you and the stairwell to the next floor. As the spot where that drip fell on you begins to burn, you suspect that this could be a pool of acid, but everyone left their pH strips at home, so you can't check. How do you test and/or get across the pool?
On the way to the next floor, the last echoing moans dying out, the ground rumbles slightly. Once you see the next floor, it's perfectly fine. It's almost as if it's going to cave in. And that's exactly what happened. You wake up in a dark cave with dim lighting. It is not an ideal space, and not one person would feel like staying there, not even Pody. There's only two visible things: the exit, and a fellow adventurer on your right. As you get up, you realise that the rumbling isn't over, and you have to get out or else be buried alive. An escape by yourself is impossible, so you have to collaborate- or, for the more evil adventurers, use- the adventurer on your right. How do you escape the collapsing chasm with the only person on your right? You MUST mention who your "partner is".
Though the fourth floor has, for the most part, collapsed, the walls are still intact, and those of you that collaborated manage to safely navigate this spleef arena and emerge on floor five. Here you find what at first appears to be much more stable ground, and yet, as you step forward, you realize that it isn't the same stone-cold floors that you had before. Your hands are covered in sand. All around you is sand. An entire sandstorm blows around the floor, awakening moreso as the demonic spirit in the center notices you. You know there must be a stairway to the next floor but you can barely see with all the sand in your eyes. You see something at your feet, in the sand. What is it? That's for you to decide. Make it something creative, to answer this prompt. You don't have to use it though. How do you get around the sand demon?
As you ascend from the floor with the sandstorm, you find what seems to be a basic floor as you get closer, however, you find that the air is ice cold, and simply exhaling makes tiny bits of frozen air particles. You feel weakened, and it's probably because of the light blue crystals hanging on the ceiling. As with many other floors, staying in it too long would damage your health heavily, so you must once more escape the floor or else risk many terrible things that can happen to your body. You could also attempt to warm up the floor to make it bearable. How do you escape/neutralize the freezing floor?
The floor below you was cooled by crystals in the cieling. Now, if these crystals are obeying the first law of thermodynamics (nevermind the second), then that heat must be going somewhere. You find out where on the next floor: It's covered in volcanic vents. It appears that something is growing out of these vents though, are they extremophiles? They appear to be worm-like, or perhaps are some kind of magic plant. Your ankle begins to burn when you realize that one has wrapped around your leg. How do you get through the thing wrapped around your leg, and across the vents? It's soft like a worm, and as thick as your calf. It's black as the soot-covered floor around it, but the vents glow an incandecent red, meaning they're over 500°C.
After 7 floors of tireless peril, you arrive on your eighth floor. It's surprisingly clear, even has a shop! As a tribute to your first prompt, you may wish for any item of choice, and the winner will actually get it. Be careful, the shopkeepers are have a Pet Peeve about those who demand for something too powerful,  to the point where they kill them. Three times, if they have to. They'll be "nice", though, and last place will live on as first place's coveted item because of magic. What will you want from the shopkeepers?
As you wander on to the next floor, the air feels crisp and super charged with something. Suddenly, the altar at the middle chucks out a massive lightning bolt that blinds all the adventurers. As the electricity sizzles around you, you must find a way to lift the lightning sphere from the altar, which also unlocks the next floor. However, whatever touches the sphere to deactivate it, dies. How will you lift the lightning sphere off the alter while keeping yourself alive?
The walls of the room are colorful, and the floor is covered in strange plants and mushrooms of all kinds. Dust and spores are floating through the air and you breath in something strange... What do you hallucinate and how does it guide you through the room?
You enter the next floor and do not see much besides a corridor with some lighting. The corridor appears to split off near the end, so you go over to check where it leads. However, when you get over there, the bricks in the wall begin to turn, and rearrange into a maze. While the bricks are turning, you are briefly able to see something on the other side of the wall. What do you see, and how do you use it to get through the maze?
Now, clearly, this isn't any ordinary vampire squid. (if you can even say there are ordinary vampire squid) They live in the deep ocean, and need presurized water to survive. This one seems to be able to survive here by creating a wall of pressurized water. How do you get past the vampire squid and water wall?
As you venture on to the next floor, you're so high up that your popped ears pop again. So high, in fact, that there are no clouds to block the stars and planets above. The window reflect all the luminary stars, but the reflection seems to be more than just another light. As a last resort from the ancients, a meteor is summoned by the window to destroy all that is left of the adventurers as the second to last line of defense guarding it's royal treasure. The exit also seems to be getting further and further away as well. Is it an illusion? Is it real? The only choice at this point is to reach for the stars. How do you get to the exit and escape the meteor?
A roar is heard from the next floor. You walk up and see a fierce and powerful dragon. It has heard you climbing the tower, trying to get through its realm, and it will put an end to this. The dragon, however, is weak and cannot fight on its own, so it harnesses magic. It uses the power of necromancy to revive the spirits of all of the adventurers who've died so far. The dragon is controlling them, and they start charging towards you. They were your friends, and now you must fight them, and then slay the dragon. One of them comes up close. A dragon is controlling the spirits of dead adventurers, what do you do to stop it?
As you walk up the final steps to the top of the tower, you see several traps. They are obvious. Too obvious. But nothing is there to stop you; the ancients never expected anyone to get this far, and certainly not two. On the other side of the floor lays a grand chest, which undoubtedly contains the tower's treasure. It reflects beautifully in the moonlight. You want it. No, you need it. It must be yours and only yours. You turn on your sole companion. Sure, they might have fought alongside you. Protected you. Were protected by you. But are they deserving? Hell no. You and your companion sprint, half at the prize, half at each other. You call upon the spirits of your fallen friends, some now your loyal followers. The prize is yours for the taking. It's time to destroy the final obstacle. How do you get the prize and kill your newly formed enemy with what lies around you?
Adventurers from all over will be coming to the Azurica Guild to prepare to set off on the Second Expedition! However, before everyone leaves, a feast will be held to mark the occasion, and get everyone up in high spirits to prepare for the quest, but there's a catch: The Mess Hall had previously been collapsed, though the reason is not known. As a result, all of you adventurers must bring your own traditional food to help everyone power through the first few days of the expedition. What do you bring to the feast?
Very full from the feast, you take some rest before heading out on the grand adventure. You get into the cozy beds in the village, and rest. You have a dream... A whole tone scale plays. Something is crawling on your skin... You wake up, frightened. But it's certainly nothing to be worried about. Everybody packs up, and begins progress down the ol' gravel path to the emerald city Azurica Dungeon. It's quite a while away though, so you need to stop for rest somewhere. After a long day of walking, the group huddles up to rest in a dark and terrifying forest. You can't sleep though, because of this tingling familiar feeling. There are spiders everywhere. All kinds. Little spiders to crawl through your clothes, and megafauna spiders to bite your arm off. How do you combat the spiders so you can rest peacefully?
As you exit the dark and scary forest, you come upon a magical berry patch with three different berries. When you pick one, you may not pick the other two types. The group splits to pick, but before they pick any, they hear a whisper drawing them towards one certain type. What berry do you pick and why?
It's been another day. Many have died in the berry fields, but there is no room for that in our busy schedule. We move on, and decide to use an actual campground to camp on this time. But everything seemed so sudden and planned. The collapsed mess hall. The thousands of spiders. The poisoned berries. Someone must be behind all this, and the tension rises. We may be in an actual campground, but somehow, it feels unsafe. The next day, everyone meets outside and looks upon one another in suspicion. One of you is guilty and you know it. Who is causing all of this misfortune, and what is your proof? There is an adventurer that's here to cause trouble, and it's your job to seek them out! 
Our surviving adventurers continue through the forest. Eventually, the trees start to thin, and it seems like they have reached the end of it. However, before they can truly exit the forest, massive, spiky tree roots spring up all around the group. There once was a legend that no one who enters this forest will come out. The forest would like to keep it that way. But our sixty aren't ready to be turned into nutrients just yet. They need to fight their way out, or die trying! How do you fight the tree roots and get out of the forest?
You come upon an old shack, at least a hundred years old, right on the edge of a wide canyon, at least a hundred meters across. There's a very rickety bridge across the canyon by the old shack, with decaying wooden planks most of the way across. Nuthatch steps on the first plank, and it cracks beneath his feet. Clearly if this bridge can't hold one of you, it won't carry all of you across, so you need to use something else. Inside the old shack, you find some floating rocks. They seem to have been collected in here by someone... Outside, you see more of these rocks, almost creating a path across the canyon. However, most of them appear to have been taken into the shack. Along with the rocks are various tools and gadgets that this old collecter must have owned. What do you do to cross the canyon safely?
After the loss of over half of the crew over a single forest (and a canyon), you come upon a small, mountainous village. It's almost as if it's... too convienient. But nevertheless, this village is the cozy village it appears to be. You are all free to go around the village and have a nice, long break. Maybe if you buy or find something cool, you could bring it with you. How do you spend your break at the village?
You take your rest and wake up early the next morning. Ahead in your path is another vast plain before the mountain. You can see your destination rising high into the sky in the distance. It gleams spectacularly. Pringles asks some of the villagers about what lies ahead. They tell you of how a wind tunnel develops in this area, blowing in freezing cold from the northern end of the mountain range. You take this into consideration as you close into the mountain, but it's still bad, especially compared to the sunny village. Freezing blades of ice starts flying sideways as you trudge through the tundra. A few dead trees spot the landscape. How do you keep warm through the wind and hail in the tundra?
After a few hours of travelling through the wind tunnel with the guidance of Dawthon's lens flare, the group stumbles across an ancient temple. Despite the nerds in the group speaking of dark creatures that "suck up your soul" and "impersonate you", the group decides to head in. Just in case the rumours are true, you pair up and go through the many corridors. A few minutes pass, and a few screams confirm the myth is true. In a panic, you all rush back, but you glance around and see everyone is here. Someone among you is not who you think they are. But how could we be sure that you are who we think you are? And so, you must answer the question... Prove you're you.
You walk out from the dungeon, keeping the imposters at bay by letting them feed on the corpses of your lost companions... Outside of the dungeon, the opening is built against a cliff face on one of the mountains on the edge of the valley of the tundra opposing the village. On the steep face of the mountain is a beautifully constructed tower with victorian-era architecture. Conveniently, there is a ladder on the side on the tower, with what looks like it could be a great way to get up the steep face. You crawl inside, and see a large clock on the other side of the room you're now in. At first, it seems odd that the clock is ticking counterclockwise, but then you realize that what you're looking at is not the clock's face; you're inside it. This is a clock tower, so of course there are lots of gears and large bits of masterfully crafted mechanical engineering, and of course you get pushed into in by that clumsy adventurer behind you. You are now getting pulled by the gears into a not-so-desirable threesome involving you and two converging sets of teeth. How can you escape the clock tower?
The group releases themselves from the clock tower, deciding that curiosity killed five too many cats. They cross over the mountain, but as they begin their descent, Gambiclack begins to whine loudly that his magic isn't working. As the group descends further, they see a very snazzy city-state in the distance; it's quite clear that the easiest way to the destination is through the state. But it was at this moment, the group realized that not one of them owned a passport, and there's no clear way to sneak past the border patrol. As far as the state was concerned, they were probably just wild books roaming around in the mountains that were angry that magic wasn't working. So, the group must attempt to enter, one way or another. How do you get into the city?
The group is given a warm welcome as you cross the border into the heart of Paracos's bustling city. As you enter, a mysterious figure approaches. He's wearing a green hoodie. He has a star on his eye... He whips it off and says, "Hey guys! Did I scare you? Well, thank you, I'm glad I did. I work here in Paracos for a travel agency, but the job gets boring sometimes, and I need to entertain myself." "Anyways, here's something that will help you all. Hope you enjoy!" He hands you a pamphlet. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/320704088339644427/370792866768879619/unknown.png The travel director seems to know your group, but it's not obvious if he'll be helping you. During your time in Paracos, you might want to take advantage of the structured society, find a way to get some money, or get some technologically advanced items. What do you do in Paracos?
A notorious group of bounty hunters from the Shadrian fields south of Paracos are known for their hatred of magic. It's seen as an evil force, one that you embody. Noticing such power centralized in your train, they collect upon you to destroy your mana. They cut the tracks, and the train is forces to screech to a halt. The side doors burst open, and several Shadrian bounty hunters enter. "Your magical items are a curse on this land," shouts one of the invaders, motioning for more to steal your emeras and staffs. You must prevent them from getting their hands on your items by any means necessary. How do you protect your stuff from the Shadrian intruders?
You arrive at a fishing village, now some distance from Paracos. You talk with some of the locals and they tell you that more information on the thing may be found in the ruins, a lost temple that's been submurged out in the ocean. A particular local invites the group to stay for the night, and tells them of a precise location. He tells you many different things, all except for the one most important thing: how to build a boat. The group decides to head out and investigate the ruins, but to get there you need a boat. The village has but a few dingy canoes, so you can't use that to take all seventeen of you to your location. How do you build a boat?
After the group assembles their 100% completely safe steampunk themed boat assembled by some_nerd, they push off of the shore and paddle into the vast ocean in search of this supposed lost temple. Many hours pass of nothing but paddling in the open sea. Someone reaches into the water and shouts that it feels much warmer than normal. However, it doesn't take much longer for the rest of the group to notice as the currents suddenly pick up and a massive serpent erupts out of the water. It has large, flowing fins that reflect the stars above and is decorated with scars from many past adventurers who met their end here. Around the serpent is a graveyard of wrecked ships, filled with old gear. The items among them range from swords to guns to paper clips to plain old boat stuff. One item sitting atop a floating plank in the water catches your eye, and it might just be the thing you need to defeat the monster. What is the item, and how will it help you defeat the serpent?
After another 24 hours of sailing on open water you find yourself... nowhere. Supplies are low, you don't want to keep eating serpent carcass. Looking into the water out of desperation, you find a glass bottle. The bottle contains a map, how convenient! You figure out your location based on where Beware: Serpent is written, and notice that a major island is labeled on the map. It is labeled Cu. Isl. and seems to be quite large, so you head towards where it should be. To the dismay of the exhausted crew, the island is not as grand as the map would have led you to believe. Over the years, it appears that someone has mined out the entirety of the island, only a collapsing shamble of stone covered in a layer of lime green sediment remains. Parts of the island have collapsed in from openings in the ground made by miners. There's an elevator shaft still on the island, which leads down into the shafts. A large sign in bold red letters displays: DO NOT ENTER. CLOSED DUE TO GROUNDWATER LEAKAGE. The sign alone should be enough incentive for you to enter, but the inscription below it gives you all the more reason to enter. This mine was founded in [YEAR] to extract copper from the island, but just months after the Cupros Company began excavating, treasures of unknown age were discovered deep in the caverns. Their origin has not yet been determined, but they have all the hallmarks of an advanced civilization. After entering the elevator, the weight of the crowd causes it to shift slightly. The lever labeled B1 is pulled and you begin your decent. Not too long after, something screeches to a halt. From the dim light, all you can see it a trace of green lining the walls of the shaft, evident of the age of the panels that make up the elevator. The panels begin to leak, rapidly. Groundwater rises to fill the elevator, as it occasionally jerks downward, grinding against the sides of the shaft. As the elevator fills with water, how do you stay safe?
You safely arrive at floor B1, and continue into the mine. As you progress deeper into the mineshaft you notice large amounts of ore along the wall. Most is copper, but in this part you find something different... The walls seem to gleam with a silver shine from magnetite between the reddish brown streaks of hematite. Suddenly, a coin flies upwards out of the pocket of some_nerd. The piles of ore around you begin to move as well, though some rocks appear to be unaffected. Some of the smaller pieces start flying around. You're now dodging shards of shrapnel coming from all directions. Something is messing with the magnetic field in this room. How do you protect yourself from the magnetic projectiles?
As the group continues deeper and deeper into the mine, the light slowly fades away, and they are left with just their hands to sense what is around them. The hatchling hops out of Pringles' pringles can. Chirping and squeeing loudly, he runs towards the smell of food. You traverse over to where the hatchling ran off to, and your hand gets covered in ants. The ants don't hurt you though, they're circling around a large stash of cookies. You and the hatchling eat up on a fair share of all sorts of cookies. But the hatchling is still unsatisfied... This is not the special cookie. The hatchling runs off again, into a crevice of the mine that appears to glow a faint blueish green. Everyone follows, but the hatchling has discovered a labyrinth of sorts. After hours of searching for the hatchling, everybody is lost and unable to find anybody else. Stuck in the labyrinth, somebody screams for help, but it doesn't help. The amplitude of that screech disrupts the structure of this deep labyrinth. As the walls collapse around you, you run through the corridors looking for an exit. While an exit is not found, you come across something else that just might save you. What do you find to get you out of the collapsing undersea labyrinth?
GreenTree uses his portal gun to navigate the maze, and, whilst thinking with portals, gets everyone to the exit. You arrive at a cavern in quite a deep part of the ocean. It's hard to see, but something is glowing here. After pushing through some wet rocks, your eyes are filled with the lights of a city skyline. Down here, in the deepest depths of the ocean is an underground kingdom with plenty of roads, buildings, temples, and probably secrets. The citizens of this city are different than those on the surface... Their eyes are more reflective, and they look at you questioningly. You ask where you are, but they do not understand your language. A tall beacon at the center of the city "beacons" you to it. You walk to it to see if you can learn from it. It shines atop a large tower, with double doors. The group splits up to explore and learn how this all works. Going through one door, it's clear that you're still under the ocean, but it's hard to tell if this is still in the city. Suddenly, several angry citizens approach, and make considerably angry noises. Clearly what you did is taboo to their culture in some way. You find yourself surrounded, and the only way out is persuasion. What do you do to explain what you've done to the citizens?
Tsutaja is killed in the brawl, but with the help of polodo's dance moves, they understand your worries, and, through their 24-hour long interpretive dance, explain to you that the beacon is sacred for its ability to teleport people back to the surface. The gang agrees to use the beacon to get back to the surface. Unfortunately, you find that you are not back home. You've landed in a biome that you have never seen in all your days of adventuring. What is this biome like?
Though you have found many amazing regions of the continent, it has proven counterproductive to your goals. How are you to work as a team to find the thing if you are so scattered across the globe? So you must embark on a quick journey to meet up once again. Navigate towards that location where you first became dislocated—the underwater city. You know the guardian serpent is dead, the passage to the city as well as the fact that the ocean economy isn't good enough to repair either; now the only problem is how are you going to find your way to the basin again? Surely in your months of adventuring you've learned techniques from those experienced sailors at some point, right? How do you navigate back to the island underwhich that city lies?
The stars move more around the pentagram, but they arrange themselves into new geometric constructions. You wonder, 'Aren't these stars many lightyears away? How can they track through the sky so fast?' You soon come to discover: Those were not stars at all. You arrive at the island, meeting up with the rest of the crew. Fortunately, everyone is still alive (though not neccesarily well). You return to the city, passing through all the same corridors, without missing a beat. Many of the obstacles you past the first time through have been worn away by time. When you rearrive in the city, you stretch and look up... Those 'stars' are still there? They glow, shining in the bleak corners of the cavern. They rise out and swarm around the city. The citizens look on in terrified confusion. The more daring of the group approaches the orbs of light for a better look. They appear to have the body of a large insect, with an abdomen alight as would that of a firefly. Unfortunately, it stings you. The sting delivers a glowing mark onto your arm, worrying if not painful. The sting begins to hurt more and more as if an iron is being held against your arm and is just now getting warmed up. You have to heal this somehow, but your first priority is to avoid another sting. Where do you take cover?
These flies, bugs, or whatever they are have guided you back here. Do they know something you don't? If they do, they didn't tell you very well. Still of a different tongue, the citizens of the underground city cannot tell you what they mean to, but they seem to have figured out what the flies knew. They're motioning you to get out of the frog pit. Why would they want you out? Perhaps, they know what you're here for. Is this where the thing is? In this zoo? Is it even a zoo at all? What kind of zoo doesn't have hot dogs? One of the frogs eats a fly. Level up! Frog has gained: +10 size, +40 communication In an authoritative voice, the frog states clearly: "I know what you're here for. Follow me if you want to complete your journey." Its voice resonates throughout the cavern like that of God. The citizens are now panicking. A door opens to the deepest of caverns. A stairway down, with rough terrain. Now you must ride through. This is not the kind of terrain you can simply walk across. The frog leaps across with ease however. If only you had the power of an animal, perhaps an exotic animal, or even a mythical one, one adjusted to odd terrain. wait... You're in an exotic zoo. What animal do you saddle up on to ride down this victory road?
You saddle up on your animals of choice and the frog of wisdom takes you to his natural habitat: The swamp. Hundreds of frogs live here, in a peaceful nature environment protected from disruption by miles of rock. They've lived in isolation for a long time. Due to your disruption, they erupt in a cry of croaking and scramble around. The other animals that lived around them scurry as well. Everything is screaming and creatures of all sizes are leaping across the cavern. It hurts your ears, but it only gets louder. The living projectiles coming from all directions don't help either. But you can't escape with the treasure so close, so... How do you endure the torment?
First thing's first. You want to be the one to take the prize, so you're going to have to find it first. You don't know what it is yet, so you'll need some advanced archeological techniques to locate it. How do you navigate around this temple and find the prize?
Just because you found it doesn't mean your enemy can't snatch it away. You need to plan your great heist to escape without your opponent noticing. How do you leave the location without your opponent noticing?
Finally, you’re going to have to cover this up veeery carefully and face international fame if you want this treasure for yourself. How will you tell the outside world of your discovery?
A streak of white bolts across the peripheral of the northern sky. A few veteren explorers go out to investigate, as they would know how to deal if any trouble were to erupt. In the northern forest, after forty three progressively tiring minutes of searching, one finds a capsule, pitch black from reentry heat at its base, but carved in a lusturous ivory-white around the remainder of the cylindrical body. It's as if an elephant's tusk had been scorched at it's root, it's like a marble column taken from temples of antiquity, it has the oddity of an Egyptian obelisk. More gather around the curious object, just before it splits clean in half along the diagonal. The two sides, equal in proportion, fall simultaneously, revealing the contents of the craft: A man, of the same shape as yourselves, but formed entirely from ivory. This man, creature, or alien, whatever it is, looks like a statue carved from the tusk of an animal, so imagine your suprise when it begins to speak! His voice is nearly metallic, but you can understand perfectly: I wonder just as you do why I came right here, this place has something useful, something in its air. I'm sure you do not need it, so if it isn't hard: I'd like for you to help me, it isn't very far. Down this little clearing, through forest straight ahead, it's rougher than it looks, you don't want to lose your head. You're gonna need some armor, for traps and tricks abound, Worse than just bruises, on this trail death is found. So head back to town, gear up, suit up, with metal and leather, or chainmail and plates. You'll need armor, believe me. So you return to town. Should you trust this guy or not? It's questionable, but surely there's no harm in having protection when you next confront the entity from the woods. What do you wear as armor?
You come back around to meet the entity from the sky, and he directs you into the forest. This forest is familiar to some of you, last season you eradicated the spiders here. That issue is long gone. Without that to worry about, you stop for a short break. Unfortunately, the group is quickly raided. Countless monkeys descend from above, and just as quickly flee back to above the treetops. The trees look incredibly high, but if a monkey could do it, surely a book could too! How do you climb to the top of the trees?
Everyone swings down from the trees, it's much easier to descend than to ascend. You emerge from the forest into an open space, with many small craters in the ground and wells. The alien from before tells you: "This is where I've been trying to find the essence of this land, it's somewhere underground, but I can't dig it up. We need to retrieve it somehow, by fishing, climbing down, or some other way your mind pleases to do so. So, what we need now is to... Find a way to retrieve the essence (or object causing the essence) from the well.
After GreenTree and the rest collect the essence with an application of the laws of magnetics, essence flies out of GreenTree's hand and toward the alien. After a brief flash of light, the alien changes appearence. They appear to have horns and several projectiles floating around them. After an unneededly long moment of tension, the alien speaks. "Whew, I'm finally no longer bound by the chains of being an average book. It's too bad we can't rest now. I, as well as many of you, have been exposed the essence. The essence enhances our magical powers, but with something like that, you know there has to be a catch. It is now easy for danger to pick up our location, whether that's monsters or those people who want to destroy magic altogether. Shortly, I will teleport you all underground. We will then make our way south, where we should be safe from monsters, bandits, or anyone who may have reason to attack and steal this essence. Until we get there, you'll have to hide the trail. Perhaps grab something to hide your location before we go into the underground." How do you cloak yourself to avoid getting detected?
nuthatch's ingenious idea to become living examples of capitalism has went so well that not one adventurer died! The group makes their way south, and out of range of whoever may be hunting down this essence. The group finally arrives at the edge of the ocean, and decides to settle in for the day. However, one of you smell thick incense and see a blinding light. When they walk out of their tent to see what's going on, they see the alien performing a ritual of some kind. The alien has altered its form, extending out wings of brought gold. The creature is like a phoenix from a distance with diamond shaped feathers and tails. Clearly frightened, everyone erupts into screams of confusion. In a flurry of panic as everyone makes their way outside, the alien throws several diamond shaped projectiles at the adventurers, unleashing a spell of fire unlike any other you've seen in your life time. The phoenix flies away in the distance, but not before a few feathers fell off. They have the same feel of the essence, and make it feel that you, along with your colleagues, can stop this alien if everyone pitches in. Powered by this feather, what do you do to stop this alien?
Lennychu’s tornados successfully extinguish Ivory’s inferno, turning the alien into a book once more. Ivory falls out of the sky, having lost its wings of fire, and descends to a spot far off in the woods. Without Ivory leading you with the essence, the Adventurers must plan to head home. First however, the group decides to seek shelter in a village across the strait, but it is too late at night to set sail. The sun has set and you must sleep, but the tents at the campsite were charred to a crisp. That's not the worst for your plans to sleep though: the tornados from earlier are raging strong. Picking up water from the strait, they have become typhoons spraying horrendous rain upon the entire area. Getting soggy is the least of your concerns (most of you should have gotten laminated beforehand... right?), but with that unbearable sound of wind and rain beating you down... How do you sleep despite the disruptions?
The group has been successfully lulled into a deep sleep. Unfortunately, just like with school, a lack of sleep has proven fatal. Those who survived wake up early the next morning, and begin sailing south at high tide. As the group settles into an unexpectedly peaceful day of sailing, the expedition heads begin looking out for the island they plan to visit as part of their search. Geobica: Hey, what did we write down on how the island looked like? Azurite: We wrote "Look for sandy beaches, land above sea level, and... oh! Signs of seabirds." Geobica: Anything else you can tell me? All these islands are inhabited, but the one we're searching is quite... unique in many ways. Although what is written down isn't very helpful, you are already familiar with these islands and can help with spotting them (aka you decide what's on them and tell us). What about this island allows you to recognize it from afar?
The group docks safely onto the island, where the sudden introduction of polluted air and bustling city life catches them off guard. Some of the city-folks in the crew swifty adapt, managing to find their way to the help desk. Barging in with an unorganized fashion, they hastily ask if there is a hotel nearby that the group can rest in. The help desk happily complies, and points you to eighteen different extravagent five-star hotels within a kilometer's walk of the building. However, before you can unload at the hotel, it's important that you take care of the injured crew members. Unfortunately, when you ask for the location of the nearest hospital or pharmacy, they give you blank stares and stutter that their healthcare funding is running low recently. And so, the adventurers must face the first first-world problem they have had in months... With no hospital or pharmacy, where do you go to tend to your wounds?
The Adventurers have successfully mastered the art of home remedies and regained a good amount of lives. Now the crew must continue their journey southward.  Before heading out, you bought materials such as wood and fabric from the city, enough to augment your dinky raft into a seaworthy boat. Now you are just about ready to set sail with a fantastic ship equipped with luxuries that the previous model lacked. As the group swiftly cruises and enjoys several days out at sea (with the exception of a noisy flock of birds waking everyone up early one day), the more vigilant books manage to fish up a feast fit for a king; no one's dying of natural causes on their watch. On the fourth day of sailing, the group spots a boat with a few suspicious entities keeping an eye out. They wave to what seems to be their higher-up, and not long after a group of wizards begin summoning a storm headed straight towards our crew! Fighting back directly is useless, but the boat definitely provides enough protection. The only problem is that no one knows where anyone else is going, and some books might be helplessly left outside to face the thunder. If you don't act now, the frenzied masses will take any available space in the rooms that are still safe. Which room do you rush to, and why?
After arriving on the sandy shores of I'm so sorry but I cannot for the life of me remember any of the names you come up with, the @Adventurers must travel accross hot sand to get to where they need to be. However, this beach seems to be incredibly long. Abnormally vast. The sand dunes are like a desert, and you have to walk for miles before you see any more than just an ocean of sand. Before you can see any grass however, you find a huge plastic wall, eight meters or more in height. You look around, and realize where you are... A giant plastic shovel blots out the sun, it's handle cracked by misuse. The shovel itself is in the shadow of a sandcastle that reaches into the clouds. Without the sun in your eyes, you're able to see that at the top of the sand castle is a glimmering crystal. Someone points it out, and now everybody is eager to snatch it for themselves. The group stays around the sandcastle for quite a while, looking for a way in, but no entrance can be seen, only a fake door that was clearly only drawn in with a toothpick as a decoration. By now, the tides from the ocean have risen, and the sandbox begins to fill with seawater. The sandcastle seems to be enduring the rushing water, a sign that it was constructed well. The water picks up some of the other things littered around the sandbox, plastic toys, shovels, trash, obnoxious children, all the things you'd find on a beach. In order to survive, you're going to have to find a way into the sandcastle. (You can assume that it's hollow, it functions as a real castle would.) How do you break your way into the sandcastle?
The group makes it into the castle, and finds present a stairwell all the way up to the top. At the very highest level of the sandcastle is a bell made of sand, within that is the glimmering object that attracted the group's attention in the first place. 96 LB ~~ (96+96+96)/96 x 🖤, being the first up the tower, tried to pull it out, but it dropped out of his hands. Before it hit the ground however, it began to glow, whir, and float away. Nobody was able to capture this object to identify it, so it left the sandcastle through a sand window. The orb seems to blow away the waters, so the group is able to chase after it through the sand while the tide recedes. Then, the orb appears to land, close to where the grass borders the sand. The group is relieved to have found healthy, normal grasslands. There are few specks of off-colored grass on the ground. Unfortunately, along with the transition is a vast array of shattered beer bottles... Wait a minute...these aren't beer bottles! The intense heat of the glowing orb is melting and reforming the sand into hundreds of thosuands of tiny shards of glass, now getting thrown everywhere. The ground around you is completely coated in glass, an impenetrable sea of it, so big that it is impossible to walk around. The only way you can make your way out is to... Improvise a way to walk on glass without hurting yourself.
After hours of rolling, dodging, sledding, strutting, and walking on stilts, the remaining 21 @Adventurers can finally sink their feet into the sand, fearless of any glass that should stand in their way. Eventually, the group reaches what seems to be the other end of the landmass. They reach what appears to be a relatively large port down, but nowhere near the size of the city from earlier. After a quick break, they take a leisurely stroll across the boardwalk to the ship they plan to take. The seaman greets the group with a kind wave of his hand, but as you get closer, you notice that he's carrying some unsettlingly valuable items. When you reach for your coins, he interrupts you. "Howdy! You're looking for the best long-distance sea transportation there is, eh? Well, you've come to the right place! Only, one thing. After decades out sailing, I have enough money for life. What I'm looking for are other goods, so I've set up a barter system: give me something you've found on your journey; treasures, discoveries, even life lessons and explain why it's useful to me. In exchange, I'll give you a ride on this ol' boat." And so, you reach into the other pocket of your bag, in search of something special you can give the man... What do you plan to give in exchange for the voyage, and how it could be useful.
The boat is small, but it is only cramped because it already has so much stuff in it. This could be a luxury cruise ship, but the halls are filled with so many ornamented decorative displays, pianos, chandeliers, bookcases, that you can barely walk through without hitting something. The dining hall is filled with no less than fifty different kinds of chairs, and the bathroom is over flowing with bottles of shampoo, toothpaste, and all kinds of lotions to the point that you can't tell which to use. The bedrooms are even more cluttered. There's a queen sized bed—touching all four walls, and many more interesting things piled about everywhere. Now, clearly, this guy has no need for all this fancy junk, so: What do you steal, and how?
Days have passed. For the past nights, the crew has went from all-mighty* adventuring force to a group of rich kids, getting completely out of the pace of real life and have surrendered the classic teenage instinct, otherwise known as going nocturnal. The days seem to pass by in a blur of luxury as their minds seem to slip into a euphoric trance. Then, suddenly on another afternoon of bathing in the jaccuzi, a familiar voice ignites their instincts... Gambi: "Hey idiots, we're almost there! Why am I not taking advantage of this moment to skewer you all? I don't know, but I sure will if you don't get off your lazy asses this instant." In a flurry of splashes, every crew member simultaneously rushes out of the pool and falls flat on their face, compeltely desensitized to the all-dangerous trap of running by the poolside. One by one, they realize that they're out of shape, out of mind, but most importantly, out of cool-adventure-tricks-and-survival-things. With the pace about to pick up once more and in so little time, the group needs to act fast; not to defeat a great monster, but a deadly assassin known as laziness. What's the best way to get back into the swing of things after a long break?
Through strict workout regimines, staged backstabbing, and 8thkingdom's swordsmanship, the crew steps off the boat ready to explore the vast seaport. However, before you can even wave goodbye to the seaman, a familiar voice chirps up, seeming more excited than ever. Gambiclack: "Aren't you guys excited? We're finally in Aurori! Land of the wizards, plains of the potions, archapeligo of the art of magic! I happen to know all the in and outs of this perfect country, I've visited at least one hundred islands and <praise> <compliment> <gushing> <vomiting> <more praise>" Gambi's propoganda seems to do nothing for the group to excite them, so they walk out of the seaport and into a pleasant village on the shores of what seems to be an endless beach. The sun glares down hard, causing the sudden urge to rush back to the boat and grab some sunscreen. However, the glowing orb has found you again. "Greetings." The voice sounds awfully like a certain alien. "Long time no see. I would take this time to indulge in the specifics of your trip, but I believe time is short. For now, I request you follow me." The orb flies into the forest nearby, at which the group takes pursuit. Before you can get to the forest however, the orb begins to glow significantly brighter. So bright that you can barely keep your eyes open. This forest might be dangerous, so you can't just keep walking with your visibility impaired by the light. How to you figure out your suroundings with such a bright light?
As you follow the orb, a familiar face greets you for the first time. They seem to be waiting to talk to you, and the voice that greeted you at the start of this expedition begins to speak again. Ivory: "You thirteen have come a long way. You've come all the way through Aurori, and are almost to the beautiful city only known as the Observational Fort. Perhaps when you see this city it will help me to regain your trust, I just know you will love it. The Observational Fort has a rich history; it was built by Aurori to gain a military advantage and you'll understand what I mean when you see it. The entire city acts as a mobile unit, capable of moving a hundred miles in a day. The way that it can accomplish this: The city can fly. It was built above the trees, encapsulated by a forcefield protecting it from attacks from below, and keeping its citizens from falling from above. With the war over, the city became more of a population center then a fortress, but after a couple of decades, the Aurori government cut funding for many of the benefits it had originally given to the Observational Fort. They decided that just because the war was over, they didn't need the city anymore, but the city is so much more than that! How can they neglect this beautiful paradise, just because it isn't the most economically viable? Before we go up into the fort, we'll be staying in the Redwood Reservation, another town built by Aurori as a military outpost. It's not like that city is getting neglected however, and we don't need it to win any wars either!", Gambi: "Oh, Ivory... it’s been decades, and you're still hogging around old weight. I guess bird brains never learns, eh? Look here. You've already proven that it's not worth keeping by the fact you've literally burned down forests. Who cares if we lose a small museum or two; we can just have memorials built in an actually successful city like the Redwood Reservation. Are you really going to keep tossing precious resources at some city that already soaks up the sun more than any other part in the world? The city is temporary, god damnit, and I think it’s time to move on!" Well, it looks like we have reached an impass. Either way, now is the time to pick a side. Should the city be saved? Why or why not?
After voting to help Ivory save the Observational Fort, the entire group hitches a ride on an elevator powered by a special kind of magic unique to the fort. You notice two main differences between the Observational Fort and the reservation below it: The air is much thinner here, and the sky is significantly clearer. It was late at night, but with the streets of the reservation lit by a powerful illuminating spell, no stars could be seen in the sky. However, up in the fort, the entire expanse of the galaxy if visible to the naked eye. It's a beautiful sight that you haven't witnessed since entering Aurori. Ivory: "See, this is what the people are missing by staying on the ground. If only we could show them how beautiful the stars are! If only they knew what there is to see... hmm, what if we were to get the word out, maybe some would come to visit, bringing their tourist dollars with them!" If you want to save this beautiful city and its view of the sky, you'll need to prove to the public that this is a sky worth seeing. What's an amazing fact about the night sky above Aurori that tourists will be amazed by?
The group gathers in the Observational Fort's main observatory. The telescope here was masterfully crafted to be able to see as far as the supernovae in other galaxies! One of the group goes up to the telescope and looks through the eyepiece. It's completely dark. "I think something's wrong with the telescope." The mechanic in the room checks the eyepiece, then looks around the back. The primary mirror of the telescope is missing. "Where could it have gone, it was here just an hour ago, as a perfect as ever! It's not like it would've been taken out for cleaning..." After looking into the telescope yourself, you notice something crucial, and it becomes obvious that the mirror was stolen. After looking around some more, you can immediately tell where the thief took it. What do you notice that helps you track down the thief and return the telescope's mirror?
Hey there, it's good to see you again! Sorry about that incident... because of the chance that this place might become deserted due to the government, looters like that are unfortunately common around these parts... yet another reason to save this dear town! However, did you see the way everyone was mildly shocked and cared? That, as well as reports from places all over Aurori indicate the once cult-level agreement in our democracy has been disturbed- in fact... I've been invited, as well as with two people of my choice, to go argue in a public court session in the heart of Aurori! There's a few problems, though. First, the destination is many, many islands away. We'll have to travel from island to island. This won't be a problem, as Azurite, Geobica, and I have our contacts for pretty much every step of the journey. Second, I can only bring two of you by my side; also not a problem, consider the journey a process of me figuring out who my two adversaries are. But, the biggest problem... is everyone else. No mage will ever be able to control the thoughts and the desires of every last person in the world. As such, countless reporters, supporters and ill-intentioned people will be after us. To avoid unnecessary publicity and/or assassination attempts... Gambi: "Hmm? What did I ever do to you? :<" Find a way to avoid public confrontation.
With Gizmo's suggestion, the tiny group manages to sneak by the eager reporters, and begin to hop islands to the center of Aurori. All goes well for a few days, and the group is on target to reach the capital on time. However, all of that changes in a tale of two islands. The boat is quite nice for a vacation, and everyone seems to be enjoying the sun, even the captain, who's sunbathing on the roof of the ship. However, while the captain wasn't looking, the boat came to a sudden stop. The boat crashed into a sharp rock, as the water here is quite shallow and there are many bits of rock and coral poking out from the ocean. A hole is made in the side, and the boat begins to tilt as it fills with water. In the ensuing panic, without an attentive captain to direct people to lifeboats, everyone decides that their best option would be to jump off. As the group begins to float on the waters, the first thing they notice is the razor sharp coral on the seafloor. There's not too many of them, but with the unpredictability of the ocean waves swaying them around, it poses a very major threat. However, with the belongings and skills of the crew, there must be something that should help them steer clear! How do you get back to shore without hitting something sharp in the water?
The group makes their way back on shore, but sadly Doggo's doggy paddling on his armor paddle did not suffice. Now on land, they can navigate the roads and bridges of Aurori and make their way to the capital. However, somewhere along the way through Aurori's confusing roads, it seems that you have gotten seperated from the reast of the group. You need to find the capital and regroup, but the island the capital is on is huge! The whole island seems to be filled with countless buildings, parks, and attractions. Every street seems to serve some significance or have some important history. When one of you pick up a local’s map, not only is it in a foreign language, it’s so cluttered with information you can’t even see the shape of the island on it. However, upon closer inspection, it seems the map divides the island into several districts. It turns out that certain types of things appear more in certain districts- one may dedicate too much space for parks, have too many street vendors, or have towers that seem to poke at the clouds. Surely if everything else has its own twist, the capital district must a well! What stands out about the capital district that helps you find your way there?
By spotting buildings with incomplete parts, the group all make it to the capital district in the heart of Aurori. That is, with the exception of nuthatch, who got overwhelmed by the sheer number of lowercase letters on the island. They manage to traverse to to Aurori's subway system. Going to a place as prestegious as Aurori's court, however, requires a special pass. Luckily, there's someone in the group who has that covered. Ivory: "Don't fret, fellow companions! I believe that I have spare passes for you all. Unfortunately, I cannot present them alongside you- as I have some... history with this nation, I am required to go through alone. I wish you the best of luck, though- just hand them over, and act normally." The group presents their passes to the appointed officer, just like how Ivory said. They glance first at your being, then at your token. Then they clasp their hands and ask in an unsettlingly calm tone, "You're from the islands right?" As you reply with a yes, they put one hand in their pocket and the other reaching for what may be some handcuffs. "How's life out there?" You realize that you have only gotten a taste of each island- however, there has to be something to describe them - is it the weather? Perhaps the locals enjoy one kind of music or food. Whatever's the case, you open your mouth and begin to speak... How would an islander describe where they live?
After barely scraping by the officer and taking the transport to the court, our final five meet up with Ivory and have some time to spare. As they look around, they see crowds of people gathering. Some judges are entering earlier than anyone else. There’s a buzz between the reporters as some official looking book takes attendance for the jury. At first you don’t pay much attention to them, until they call an all-too familiar name... “Is Gambiclack here?” Gambi: "Present~!" Gambi gives Ivory an unsettling wink before heading off with a mischievous skip into the court. As you all watch this, you realize the same thing. Ivory: "So that’s why they’ve been acting so nicely, getting on the law’s good side and rigging the random choice to pick them.. well, I think we know what’s going to happen if Gambi stays there with their opinions and... er... “charm”. I’m not one for pushing the envelope- let alone ripping it to shreds- when it comes to law, but it looks like we might just have to do that. In any case, we’re going to have to..." Find a way to make sure Gambi won’t be on the jury.
As Snivy brings up Gambi's age to be at a mere 12, Gambi's smirk gets completely wiped off as the staff check and confirm that Gambi is indeed a preadolescent. Within a few seconds, Gambi goes from cool and collected to utterly flustered. Unfortunately, the pre-teen just got drawn another card by hearing Snivy's reasoning. Gambi: "H-hey, that's no fair! If I can get kicked out of court for age, then just look at those scruffballs! Look at the dirt on their covers, their pages are so disorganized, and- oh my, are those weapons?" Gambi may only be a child, but a threat must be examined. Thankfully, the crew was able to distance themselves far enough from the security guards so they got lost in the crowd. Nevertheless, Gambi's point still stands, and you must find a quick way to make yourselves presentable. There just so happens to be a city with most of the resources you need, so... How do you make yourself presentable for court?
Ivory: "Adventurer Good news, crew! Through some negotiation and a stack of paperwork, I’ve managed to have all four of you present in court alongside me. I say we’ve had enough distractions, yeah? As you’ve prepared for this moment, I have no doubts that we’ll win this case unless some divine intervention happens. So keep a serious face, stand straight up, and you’ll all be just fine..." What happens next is a blur. Ivory, alongside the final four, manages to survive on the battlefield of law. The case drags on for hours, and the jury who usually doses off halfway through is focusing heavily on the situation. And finally, it’s time for Ivory to present the closing statement. However, as she delivers the last of dialogue to her acquaintances, rioters catapult Bazinga’s corpse into the room, breaking hours of tension in the worst way possible. They somehow managed to keep the flames on Baz’s hands alive, and they quickly spread out to cover the entire room. There are shouts everywhere, but fortunately guards have arrived to safely escort everyone out of the room. Everyone, with the exception of Ivory and the final four. Ivory: "Well, this doesn’t look good. With people tripping over eachother to get out, there's no way we can all leave here unharmed. Fortunately, it looks like we have a lot to work with, as this room has been crammed with decoration. Those windows up high may make some good emergency exits as well. So... let’s get thinking before you all get charred by the fire." With the materials inside the courtroom, how do you make your escape?
With all your willpower, though it leaves you mentally exhausted, you both manage to escape Bazinga's flames. The other two didn't seem to be as lucky as you, and the fire continues to rampage through the building. You make a beeline out of the capital, having had your share of chaos for 244 days. Even several blocks away, you can still hear crackling in the distance as Aurorian authorities desperately try to suppress the flames. Although the fire is now quite contained, the attention of the police is spread outward. They think the fire was the result of an attack, and they are now in the phase of tracking down the suspected arsonist. One officer assigned to the block you're on comes up to you and notices your burns. "Are you alright? It looks like you just ran from that courthouse." "Yeah, I'm alright, I'm just on my way out of town." The officer looks up and down at your burn marks suspiciously and jots something down on his pocket notebook. "I see..." You suspect this won't end well. If you don't want any authorities on your trail, you'll have to lose them, and fast. Odds are, your rival is thinking the same thing, and the authorities won’t stop until one pf you is captured. The limelight can wait as you prepare for one final challenge. You get back to the Observational Fort without even a glance back at the smoke rising from Aurori. You're going to need a quick excuse right now to minimize the odds they catch on to you. Actually, you might need this for the whole escape, so... How do you try to convince the authorities that it was the other who started the fire?
Even with the police diverted to investigating your opponent, they won't let you out that easily, that is, if they notice you doing anything suspicious again. In order to make sure that you don't get caught up in Aurori's investigations again, you need to get out, and the best place for that is the Observational Fort. You keep to get there quickly and quietly to stay safe. How do you quickly escape to the Observational Fort?
You have escaped to the Observational Fort. Hooray! You're safe from the police... right? Unfortunately, the other suspect has also happened to have made his way to the fort as well, bringing it into the attention of the police. Now that you’re stuck in a city and you have no way out, your fate lies in how well you know the city you worked so hard to protect. How do you hide from police in the Observational Fort for long enough that the other is found?
